Following successful beta validation, IntelliRoom will transition to a freemium subscription model:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Free Tier:} Limited AI generations per month, basic styles, watermarked downloads (continues indefinitely for user acquisition)
    \item \textbf{Premium Tier:} Significantly more generous generation limits, full Egyptian/Islamic style library, 4K downloads, no watermarks
    \item \textbf{Professional Tier:} Unlimited generations plus collaboration tools, client presentation features, priority queue, PDF exports
    \item \textbf{Business Tier:} To be determined based on enterprise needs, featuring team accounts, analytics, white-label options
    \item \textbf{Marketplace Revenue:} Affiliate commissions on furniture sales referred to Egyptian retailers (percentage-based, negotiated per partner)
    \item \textbf{Future Opportunities:} Featured retailer placements, B2B API access, white-label partnerships with real estate developers
\end{itemize}

The pricing strategy emphasizes affordability for the Egyptian market while remaining sustainable. All pricing remains flexible and subject to adjustment based on beta phase learnings and market conditions.
