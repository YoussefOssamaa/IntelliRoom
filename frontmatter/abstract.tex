\vspace{1cm}

Interior design platforms lack cultural awareness for MENA markets. Local aesthetics, traditional furniture styles, and regional preferences remain underserved by Western-focused AI solutions. This gap represents a substantial market opportunity as the industry grows from \$18.32B (2024) toward projected valuations above \$184B.

\textbf{IntelliRoom} addresses this challenge by leveraging state-of-the-art AI models---including SAM2 for precision image segmentation, ControlNet for structural preservation during style transformations, and Florence-2 for intelligent object detection---to provide culturally-aware room redesign specifically tailored to Egyptian and MENA market aesthetics. The platform enables users to upload photographs of their rooms and receive design suggestions that respect Islamic geometric patterns, traditional Arabic furniture arrangements, and local material preferences.

The proposed system architecture combines advanced computer vision techniques with a ComfyUI-based generative AI engine, implementing multi-stage pipelines that integrate detection, segmentation, style transfer, and inpainting workflows. A novel Egyptian furniture retrieval framework connects users with local manufacturers and craftsmen, differentiating IntelliRoom from competitors such as COOHOM, Interior AI, and RoomGPT through deep cultural specialization.

This graduation project demonstrates how artificial intelligence can be localized to serve regional design preferences, bridging the gap between cutting-edge AI capabilities and the cultural intelligence required for meaningful adoption in Egyptian and MENA markets. The platform represents a significant contribution to democratizing interior design through technology while preserving cultural authenticity.
